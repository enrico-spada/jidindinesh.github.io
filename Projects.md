Project lead: Ass. Prof. Natalia Díaz Rodríguez<br/>Computer Science and System Engineering Department,Autonomous Systems and Robotics      group,ENSTA ParisTech<br/>
The aim is building, annotating and create a dataset that could be known as the “ImageNet” for the blind, i.e., a dataset of images        taken from a wearable camera worn by blind people (or with their phones), that can later facilitate image captioning and question          answering to help them be more independent in their daily lives.
